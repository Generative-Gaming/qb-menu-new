This is a modified version of qb-menu. It has added animation and a bit of a nicer look and feel to it.

To change any colours, go to HTML>Style.css and look for background-color and color for text and background colors.... Box-shadow for the outer glow. 
To remove animations you will need to remove the keyframes from CSS
